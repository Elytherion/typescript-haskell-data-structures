# typescript-haskell-structures

Immutable Haskell-like data structures for TypeScript

This package provides ES6 Modules containing FP wrappers for native JavaScript data structures like `Array`, `Map` and `Object`.

In the future, own implementations (no use of special native structures like `Map` and `Set`) might be possible.
